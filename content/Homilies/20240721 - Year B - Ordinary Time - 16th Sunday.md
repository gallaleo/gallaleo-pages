## 20240721 - [[Year B - Ordinary Time - 16th Sunday]]


- It's important to have boundaries in life, but sometimes you may feel guilty for enforcing them
	- Aren't I supposed to be generous? Am I unkind if I say no to something?
	- The question isn't whether to be flexible or firm, but when to be each one
	- A good life has a healthy mix of selfish boundaries and unselfish giving
	- You don't have to be all things at all times
	- Sometimes you pour for others and sometimes you refill your own cup
	- You do need to be present though, to be aware, to be able to figure out what the current moment is calling for

- In the first part of the Gospel,
	- Jesus said to the apostles "Come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while"
	- We all need time to rest and recover
	- The Apostles had been sent on a mission to serve
	- They were sent out in pairs, taking nothing with them except a staff
	- No food, no bag, no money
	- They went out with a message of repentance, to anoint the sick, and to heal those in need
	- This journey I am sure would have been tiring, never knowing if they were going to be welcomed or not any place they went
	- Not knowing where their next meal would come from
	- Not knowing if they would have a place to stay for the night

- But go out they did, fulfilling the mission Jesus had sent them on
	- Doing what they were meant to be doing
	- Serving others as Jesus had taught them and as Jesus had done Himself
	- And they had many successes
	- They had cast out many demons and anointed and cured many people

- So, they must have had a feeling of having accomplished their mission
	- But no matter how successful you are, you need time to rest
	- Does not our body require us to rest when needed?
	- If we don't get enough rest, we actually become less able to do our daily activities
	- Sure we can go with less rest for short periods of time, but over time, that has an impact on us
	- The longer you go without enough rest, the more of an impact on you that will have
	- So Jesus invited the Apostles to take some time to rest

-  In the second part of the Gospel, we hear how Jesus and the Apostles went into the boat to go to the place of rest, 
	- and how the people saw where they were going and went ahead so that when Jesus and the Apostles arrived, there was a crowd already gathered
	- Jesus saw that the people looked lost, that they were like a sheep without a shepherd
    - Jesus could have left them there and gone off to another quiet place, but he didn't
    - He and the Apostles may have needed rest
    - But in this moment, He saw the need in the people
  
- Being spiritually lost can be difficult to see in others and in ourselves
    - When we have a physical ailment, we have symptoms that are usually easy to identify and help in the process of figuring out what is wrong
    - When we are lost spiritually, we may act as we normally do, but on the inside, something just doesn't feel right
    - It can be hard to say what the matter really is in this situation

- In my experience, when I get that lost feeling, that feeling that something is wrong, but I can't really say what the problem is
	- this is when I find that stepping back and taking some time to rest and reflect is what I need
	- often, I will turn to the Gospel of the day or the Sunday Gospel for the week and spend some time thinking about it
	- for me, this has been a way to find my connection back to God, to find my way forward spiritually
	- I was talking to someone the other day and when they found out that I was a Deacon, they asked me if I practice what I preach
	- I had to admit, that not always, but in all honesty, I do try
	- We all struggle sometimes, but what is important, is to know what we can always start again, to keep trying, no matter how bleak the outcome looks

- What we read in the Scriptures has that ability to help us find the meaning and direction we need in our lives if we just take some time with what we read
	- I have read a given passage from Scripture at different points in my life when I am dealing with different situations
	- and I have found that different words or phrases will pop out for me based on the current situation I am dealing with
	- The Word of God is the Living Word, static in what is written on the page, but dynamic in the meaning that we draw from it

- For the people gathered, Jesus' Word was what they needed to help them, to help them to spiritually find their way forward
    - We frequently refer to Jesus as the Good Shepherd
    - He tends to His flock, the people of God
    - Guiding us along our journey
    - Jesus, our Shepherd, sacrificed Himself for our salvation, through His Crucifixion and Resurrection.
    - He knows what we need
    - But Jesus doesn't just tend to the select few, He tends to the whole flock, including the great crowd that they encountered.
    - We have to allow Him into our lives though for Him to help us
    - He is always there waiting for us

- One of the reasons Jesus was such a good teacher was His way, how He taught
    - He taught by placing others first
    - But He took time to rest when He needed
    - He had compassion for those that He taught
    - He taught with Truth and authority
    - His teaching challenged people as they also challenge us.
    - He teaches us to have compassion for others

- To me, compassion is something that helps me to step back from judging people
    - It helps me to look at things from the other person's perspective
    - I challenge myself to come up with a plausible reason why,  if I was in that person's shoes, I might see things the way they do
    - And if I can come up with at least one reasonable idea, then I figure there must be many more reasons that I haven't though of
    - That helps to stop me from judging the person, to try to see things from their view, to see things through their perspective instead of through my own

- So, as we prepare to celebrate the Eucharist, let us think about what I mentioned at the beginning of my Homily
	- Sometimes you pour from your own cup to help others and sometimes you need to take time to refill your own cup
	- So, the question is for any given moment, "What does this moment call for?"
	- Am I being called to help someone?
	- Or am I being called to rest and spend some time with God, refilling my own cup?
	- Do I need to try harder?  Or do I need to Just BE?
