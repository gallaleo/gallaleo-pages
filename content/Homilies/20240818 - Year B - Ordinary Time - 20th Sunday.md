## 20240818 - [[Year B - Ordinary Time - 20th Sunday]]


- Wisdom presents itself in many forms in our lives and is often a choice we need to make.  
	- Wisdom can be the choice of whether to offer advice to a friend who has come to you with a problem
		- or to just listen to them, which sometimes can be more helpful than advice
		- sometimes, a person just needs us to be present for them, so that they feel heard
	- It can be the choice to stick to your diet, or to stop and have that scoop of ice cream from the store you just walked by
		- sometimes, the ice cream is the right choice!!
	- what might be a wise decision on one day may not be a wise decision on another day
	- sometimes, it is a matter of perspective

- Both the first and second readings today make a reference to Wisdom.
	- from the first reading, the words "walk in the way of insight" jumped out for me
	- Insight means: the capacity to gain an accurate and deep intuitive understanding of a person or thing
	- or more simply put: the ability to understand something deeply and clearly
	- to gain insight, I think it helps to take the time to ask questions, to try to fully understand a situation, to find out what you don't know instead of assuming you understand the situation, to be curious about what you don't know
	- an example of insight is:
		- Imagine a teacher noticing that a student who usually excels in class has suddenly started performing poorly
		- Instead of just assuming the student is being lazy, the teacher talks to the student and discovers that the student is dealing with a difficult situation at home
		- The teacherâ€™s understanding of the deeper issue and their ability to see beyond the surface is an example of insight
		- This insight helps the teacher to know how to help the student given their current situation
	- we can also gain wisdom from being curious!
- We all have challenges and difficulties in our lives
	- our faith does not promise that we will escape having to encounter challenges
	- no one can escape encountering difficult situations
	- and we won't always make the right choices
	- but it is through our choices that we gain wisdom, the good choices and the not so good choices
	- and our faith can help us to be patient through the challenges we face, giving us strength to move forward
	- wisdom allows us to talk in the way of insight, to walk in the light of our faith

- Interestingly enough, I have had more than a couple of conversations about wisdom over the last 3 or 4 weeks.
	- And in all of them, me or someone else has brought up the following prayer:
		- God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
		- the Courage to change the things that I can
		- and the Wisdom to know the difference
	- You may know this as the Serenity Prayer
	- It resonates with me a lot and with others in the conversations I have had on Wisdom recently
	- And at the end of the day, I think a big source of learning Wisdom is taking time to reflect on the choices you have made, the outcomes those choices have brought and whether they were the right choices
	- But not so that you can be hard on yourself for making a bad decision, but so that you can look to improve the decisions you make in the future

- In the Gospel, we hear words from Jesus that presented the people of the time with a huge challenge.
	- "I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."
	- "Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day"
	- There were those who immediately closed their minds to Jesus's words, not even trying to understand them
	- They weren't even curious enough to find out more.  That was their choice.
	- Others had questions as they struggled with trying to understand His words.
	- Even today, with all of the scholarly explanations of these words, it can still be a challenge for us to understand what they mean

- Part of why it might be difficult to understand is that the Eucharist is a mystery of faith
	- a mystery of divine love
	- a mystery of the divine presence of Christ
	- The Eucharist re-enacts and re-presents the sacrificial death of Jesus every time we celebrate it at Mass
	- When we celebrate the Eucharist, we renew the life of grace which we received at Baptism
	- some of the most spiritual and peaceful moments that I have experienced have been in prayer in front of the Blessed Sacrament
	- The Eucharist unites us with Christ, a union of God's love for us, 
		- through His Son's sacrifice and the sacrifices that we make in encountering the challenges that we face and the choices we make
	- I'll repeat a particular phrase that Jesus said
		- He "wants to raise them up", 
		- Jesus wants to enrich and help us in our lives
	- When we choose to participate in the Eucharist, we give Jesus the chance to do that
	- But it's not a single event, it's a process that we repeat with the hopes of gaining better insight into our faith

- Wisdom also teaches us that we can become so accustomed to a good thing that we begin to take that good thing for granted
	- people often refer to a spouse or a close friend or a parent when they think about taking things for granted
	- but this idea can just as easily be applied to our thoughts on receiving the Eucharist at Mass
	- when you receive the Eucharist at Mass, is it an experience of gratitude? of reverence that you are receiving Jesus?  do you say Amen when you receive the Host?

- The freedom that we have to practice our faith freely and publicly because of where we live, that freedom does not exist everywhere in the world
	- there are those who have to hide their faith for fear of persecution
	- there are those who are not able to receive the Eucharist every Sunday at Mass
	- when was the last time you said thank you to God for the gift of the Eucharist?

- So as we prepare to celebrate the Eucharist, let us
	- think about the choices in our lives
	- are we taking the time to reflect on our choices to see if they were wise choices or not?
	- do we take the Eucharist for granted in our lives?
	- do we recognize it for the gift from God that it is?
	- are we allowing Jesus into our lives, to allow Him to help raise us up?
