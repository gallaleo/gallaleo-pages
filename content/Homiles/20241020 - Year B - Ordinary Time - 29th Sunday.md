# Gospel  
### Mark 10:35-45
  
James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him and said to him,  
   “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.”  
He replied, “What do you wish me to do for you?”  
They answered him, “Grant that in your glory  
   we may sit one at your right and the other at your left.”  
Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking.  
Can you drink the cup that I drink  
   or be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?”  
They said to him, “We can.”  
Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink, you will drink,  
   and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized;  
   but to sit at my right or at my left is not mine to give  
   but is for those for whom it has been prepared.”  
When the ten heard this, they became indignant at James and John.  
Jesus summoned them and said to them,  
   “You know that those who are recognized as rulers over the Gentiles  
   lord it over them,  
   and their great ones make their authority over them felt.  
But it shall not be so among you.  
Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you will be your servant;  
   whoever wishes to be first among you will be the slave of all.  
For the Son of Man did not come to be served  
   but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.”  


# Homily

- How many of you, when you were a kid, knew what you wanted to be when you grew up?
	- And how many of you are doing what you wanted to be then, now that you are actually grown up?
- When I was young, probably around the age of 14 or 15, I wanted to become an autobody mechanic
	- I wanted to follow in my father's footsteps
	- Autobody work and fixing cars is not easy work.  And definitely less so back in those days as they didn't have all the time-saving equipment back then that they do today
	- And back then, it was usually cheaper to fix a fender than to order a new one and replace it, so there was a lot more tedious manual labor involved
- Now, my Dad worked in this field for 35+ years before he retired
	- And he knew how hard the work was
	- And I don't think he wanted me to follow in his footsteps
	- But he also knew better than to tell me that this wasn't a good idea for a career path for me
- He sometimes took on side jobs in the evening to earn some extra money
	- So he decided to take me along on one of these side projects to let me help out, to give me first hand experience doing the work that he did
	- I got paid a bit of money to help out and I got to so some of the real work
	- While it was good to earn a little spending money, one thing I realized quickly is that this was not what I wanted to spend the rest of my career doing
	- Now if this is something you are passionate about and this is something you love doing, then this field can be a great opportunity to do some neat things
	- But for me, it was one of those cases of 'be careful what you ask for!'

- And this reminds me of today's Gospel.
    - James and John asked Jesus for a favor. 
    - They wanted him to place them at Jesus's right and left hand in His glory.
    - The thing was, they didn't realize what they were asking for.
    - This was the third time that Jesus had told the apostles what was going to happen to him, but Jesus knew that they didn't understand.
    - The cup that Jesus had before Him was not the same cup that James and John thought that Jesus was going to drink.
- Jesus doesn't tell James and John that they were foolish and didn't know what they were asking.
    - Instead, He gently explains to them that what they are asking for is not what they think it is.
    - And that those two positions were not His to assign
    - Jesus also saw that they were putting their desires for power and glory first without understanding the cost.

- Be careful what you ask for!
	- By the same token though, know that what God gives you has purpose
	- that what God gives you will take you to where you need to be, to follow His path, the path that will take you towards the salvation He has in store for you
- A couple of years later, when I was in grade 11, I decided to take a new class that was being offered for the first time at my high school, a computer class
	- once I started using a computer, I knew that this was what I wanted to do for a career
	- and for the last 36 years and counting, I have been working with computers as a profession, as a means to pay the bills, and as something I am still passionate about
		- programming them, fixing them, setting them up and basically, making them do things to make peoples lives easier.

- This isn't the first time Jesus has had to say something to the Apostles to set them straight on the way forward
	- they are disciples after all and still learning
	- but Jesus also knows the time of His ultimate sacrifice is getting closer and that soon, the Apostles will be taking on the leadership of the faithful, leading them in what will become the Church that today, we are members of
	- the Apostles are the future leaders of the Church and those who will start building it up
	- and in today's Gospel, Jesus uses the examples of the leaders of the time to highlight what He does not want them to do
	- He does not want them to lord it over the people
	- In fact, He says "whoever wishes to be great among you will be your servant; whoever wishes to be first among you will be the slave of all"
	- "The Son of Man came to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many"
	- Leadership through service is the model Jesus wants them to follow
	- Leading mercifully, leading with forgiveness.
- Jesus knows that this path is not easy!
	- In fact, many of the Apostles were persecuted and even martyred for following Jesus and spreading His message

- These days, many people seem to be seeking happiness in their lives and are disappointed when they don't find it
	- But I don't really think happiness is something you seek out
	- Our society today seems to be focused on material possessions and power as the way to happiness
	- James and John might have got wrapped up in the idea of power and glory when they made their request to Jesus to sit at His left and right

- I read something the other day about happiness that got me thinking
	- "Happiness is a byproduct of a meaningful life"
	- What does that mean?
	- I think it means that instead of focusing on material things or power and glory to make us happy, we should be focusing on living well, on living a life that has meaning
	- If we are doing what we are meant to be doing in our lives, living a life that has meaning, happiness will find its way into our lives on its own
	- For me, that means following the path that God has made for me
	- And while there have been times when I think I might have made some wrong turns, so far, for the most part, I think I am on the right track
	- In my work and in my vocations, I feel like I have done things that have brought meaning to my life and those of others, and I continue to look for ways to do that

- Although Jesus knew that the path the Apostles were to follow would not be easy
	- He also knew that they were steadfast in their faith
	- He knew that if they followed God's path, despite being persecuted, they would find meaning in their lives and the work they did for others
	- They would find happiness in what they did and eventually, the true joy of a life in their eternal reward
	- That His and their sacrifices would be worth it

- So as we prepare to celebrate the Eucharist, let us
	- think about what we are asking for in our lives
	- Is what we are asking for going to bring meaning to our lives or are we searching for happiness through possessions or power?
	- Are we finding ways to serve in our lives on the path God has laid out for us?
