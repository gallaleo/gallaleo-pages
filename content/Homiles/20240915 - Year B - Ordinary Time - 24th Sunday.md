# Mark 8.27-35 of Sunday September 15, 2024

Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?” And they answered him, “John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, one of the Prophets.”  
  
Jesus asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Christ.” And he sternly ordered them not to tell anyone about him.  
  
Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man must undergo great suffering, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. He said all this quite openly.  
  
And Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. But turning and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are thinking not as God does, but as humans do.”  
  
Jesus called the crowd with his disciples, and said to them, “Whoever wants to become my follower, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake, and for the sake of the Gospel, will save it.”


# 20240915 - Homily

- Who do you say that I am?
	- In today's Gospel, we hear Jesus ask his disciples "Who do you say that I am?"
	- An interesting question
	- Given our faith, one might think it easy to answer
	- But is it really that easy to answer?

	- Think about this!
	- If you went up to each of your friends, and asked them the question "Who do you say that I am?"
	- I am sure that each of their answers would probably contain some similarities, but also some differences
	- I think the reason for this is that how they answer that question will depend a lot on your relationship with the person answering the question
	- Some friends will be closer you than others
	- Some friends will have things in common with you that others don't
	- And the nature of your friendship will also be a factor
	- You will have had some common experiences with some of your friends, but often, your experiences with each of your friends will have some unique qualities
	- One thing I have learned though, is that every relationship that you have with someone is unique and different from any other relationships that you have
	- At the end of the day, I think the answer to this question has a lot to do with your relationship with the person asking the question!
	- And the answer to Jesus's question will depend totally on your relationship with Jesus

- So, when Jesus asked this question to the disciples, their answers had a lot to do with their relationship with and the experiences that they have had with Jesus.
	- They saw the miracles, the healing works that he had done
	- They heard his preaching
	- He taught them many things that they needed to know
	- And Jesus often would explain things to them in more detail than He would to the general public

- Now, here's an interesting point.  Jesus didn't ask them "Who do you say that I am?" because He wanted to know who they thought He was
	- Jesus already knew how they would answer
	- He already knew who they thought He was
	- Jesus asked the question because He wanted the **disciples** to think about who Jesus was
	- Anytime Jesus asks someone a question in Scripture, it is important!
	- Jesus already knows the answer to the question He is asking
	- When Jesus asks a question in Scripture, we should pay attention
	- He wants us to think about something important

- Healthy relationships involve honesty, trust, respect and open communication between each other
	- And they take effort and compromise from both people
	- It's not about power or judgement
	- There is respect for each other’s each other's point of view
	- There are other qualities needed for a healthy relationship as well
	- for example, often, people think that opening up and being vulnerable comes after trust, but actually, once you switch this equation around, it can be vulnerability that leads to trust and more meaningful relationships

- Healthy relationships also grow and evolve over time
	- Sometimes it is due to a shared challenge
	- Sometimes it is due to working through a difference of opinion or a misunderstanding
	- Sometimes it is because the other person was there for you when you needed them
	- Jesus is always there for you when you need Him
	- These situations can help strengthen a relationship and build trust

- Think about your relationship with Jesus
	- Who do you say that Jesus is?
	- Scripture tells us that we are created in the image of God
	- But think about the image of God that you hold in your heart
	- How you see God will be based on your experiences of God in your life
	- Do you see God as a loving Father?  Or as a displeased Father?
	- Do you see Jesus as a teacher, a guide, a brother, a friend?
	- What about as a Savior?
	- The answers to these questions will depend a lot on your relationship with Jesus!

- In the Gospel, Jesus is very frank with the disciples in telling them about what is soon going to come to pass
	- that He will undergo much suffering, he will be killed and that after three days, he will rise again
	- Jesus knew the sacrifice that He would need to make, for His disciples, and for all of us
	- the relationship that Jesus and the disciples had with each other had to have involved the elements of a healthy relationship
	- but there were also times that may have tested that relationship, at least on the part of the disciples
		- Hearing Jesus tell them that He was going to die must have been one of those times
		- After hearing Jesus's words, Peter took Jesus to the side and started to rebuke Jesus for what He said
		- Peter must have been fearful of losing Jesus after hearing what He said to the disciples
	- However, Jesus is clear on the path He must follow and in turn rebukes Peter
	- In turn, helping Peter to see that God's ways are different than our ways

- There are many different ways to build and strengthen a relationship with someone
	- while some relationships may seem effortless
	- healthy relationships take effort and work
	- some of the ways to build relationship with friends that come to mind for me are:
		- listening to one another
		- spending time together and sharing experiences
		- being open and understanding and respectful with one another
	- some of the ways to build relationship with Jesus that come to mind are
		- spending time in prayer
		- taking time for reflection, speaking to Jesus and taking time to listen to Jesus
		- partaking in the Sacraments

- I recently went on a 5 day silent retreat
	- I turned off all my social media and phone apps to remove those distractions
	- And it's funny, people that I have talked to about the retreat tended to have one of two different perspectives on it
		- Some said how they wished that they could go on a silent retreat
		- Others said that they didn't think that they could do a retreat like that
	- I have to say though, that one of the biggest things I enjoyed about it was having space and time to think and to reflect
	- Having no fixed agenda for your day other than knowing what time breakfast, dinner and supper were was very freeing
	- It improved my relationship with Jesus and my prayer life
	- Sometimes we get into a routine and everything we do becomes something on a todo list that needs to be checked off
	- Our relationship with Jesus should NOT be like that
	- Jesus doesn't need a lot of time from us, but the time we spend with Him should be His
	- My time on the retreat gave me an opportunity to think about my life and who am I am a person
	- It gave me time to listen to Jesus and to my own thoughts
	- It gave me time to think about my relationship with Jesus and with others
	- I highly recommend it

- So as we prepare to celebrate the Eucharist, let us
	- let us think about our relationships with others
	- are we giving our relationship with Jesus the time that it needs
	- let us think about how we would answer Jesus if He asked us:
		- Who do you say that I am?
