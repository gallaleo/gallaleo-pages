# Proverbs 9.1-6 of Sunday August 18, 2024

Wisdom has built her house,  
she has hewn her seven pillars.  
She has slaughtered her animals,  
she has mixed her wine,  
she has also set her table.  
She has sent out her servant girls,  
she calls from the highest places in the town,  
“You that are simple, turn in here!”  
  
To those without sense she says,  
“Come, eat of my bread  
and drink of the wine I have mixed.  
Lay aside immaturity, and live,  
and walk in the way of insight.”

# Psalm 34 of Sunday August 18, 2024

R. Taste and see that the Lord is good.
  
I will bless the Lord at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul makes its boast in the Lord; let the humble hear and be glad. R.  
  
O fear the Lord, you his holy ones, for those who fear him have no want. The young lions suffer want and hunger, but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing. R.  
  
Come, O children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord. Which of you desires life, and covets many days to enjoy good? R.  
  
Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. R.


# Ephesians 5.15-20 of Sunday August 18, 2024

Brothers and sisters, be careful how you live, not as unwise people but as wise, making the most of the time, because the days are evil. So do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.  
  
Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit, as you sing Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, singing and making music to the Lord in your hearts, giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

# John 6.51-58 of Sunday August 18, 2024

Jesus said to the people: “I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”  
  
The people then disputed among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”  
  
So Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day; for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in them.  
  
“Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like that which your ancestors ate, and they died. But the one who eats this bread will live forever.”
#### Homily


- Wisdom presents itself in many forms in our lives and is often a choice we need to make.  
	- Wisdom can be the choice of whether to offer advice to a friend who has come to you with a problem
		- or to just listen to them, which sometimes can be more helpful than advice
		- sometimes, a person just needs us to be present for them, so that they feel heard
	- It can be the choice to stick to your diet, or to stop and have that scoop of ice cream from the store you just walked by
		- sometimes, the ice cream is the right choice!!
	- what might be a wise decision on one day may not be a wise decision on another day
	- sometimes, it is a matter of perspective

- Both the first and second readings today make a reference to Wisdom.
	- from the first reading, the words "walk in the way of insight" jumped out for me
	- Insight means: the capacity to gain an accurate and deep intuitive understanding of a person or thing
	- or more simply put: the ability to understand something deeply and clearly
	- to gain insight, I think it helps to take the time to ask questions, to try to fully understand a situation, to find out what you don't know instead of assuming you understand the situation, to be curious about what you don't know
	- an example of insight is:
		- Imagine a teacher noticing that a student who usually excels in class has suddenly started performing poorly
		- Instead of just assuming the student is being lazy, the teacher talks to the student and discovers that the student is dealing with a difficult situation at home
		- The teacher’s understanding of the deeper issue and their ability to see beyond the surface is an example of insight
		- This insight helps the teacher to know how to help the student given their current situation
	- we can also gain wisdom from being curious!
- We all have challenges and difficulties in our lives
	- our faith does not promise that we will escape having to encounter challenges
	- no one can escape encountering difficult situations
	- and we won't always make the right choices
	- but it is through our choices that we gain wisdom, the good choices and the not so good choices
	- and our faith can help us to be patient through the challenges we face, giving us strength to move forward
	- wisdom allows us to talk in the way of insight, to walk in the light of our faith

- Interestingly enough, I have had more than a couple of conversations about wisdom over the last 3 or 4 weeks.
	- And in all of them, me or someone else has brought up the following prayer:
		- God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
		- the Courage to change the things that I can
		- and the Wisdom to know the difference
	- You may know this as the Serenity Prayer
	- It resonates with me a lot and with others in the conversations I have had on Wisdom recently
	- And at the end of the day, I think a big source of learning Wisdom is taking time to reflect on the choices you have made, the outcomes those choices have brought and whether they were the right choices
	- But not so that you can be hard on yourself for making a bad decision, but so that you can look to improve the decisions you make in the future

- In the Gospel, we hear words from Jesus that presented the people of the time with a huge challenge.
	- "I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."
	- "Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day"
	- There were those who immediately closed their minds to Jesus's words, not even trying to understand them
	- They weren't even curious enough to find out more.  That was their choice.
	- Others had questions as they struggled with trying to understand His words.
	- Even today, with all of the scholarly explanations of these words, it can still be a challenge for us to understand what they mean

- Part of why it might be difficult to understand is that the Eucharist is a mystery of faith
	- a mystery of divine love
	- a mystery of the divine presence of Christ
	- The Eucharist re-enacts and re-presents the sacrificial death of Jesus every time we celebrate it at Mass
	- When we celebrate the Eucharist, we renew the life of grace which we received at Baptism
	- some of the most spiritual and peaceful moments that I have experienced have been in prayer in front of the Blessed Sacrament
	- The Eucharist unites us with Christ, a union of God's love for us, 
		- through His Son's sacrifice and the sacrifices that we make in encountering the challenges that we face and the choices we make
	- I'll repeat a particular phrase that Jesus said
		- He "wants to raise them up", 
		- Jesus wants to enrich and help us in our lives
	- When we choose to participate in the Eucharist, we give Jesus the chance to do that
	- But it's not a single event, it's a process that we repeat with the hopes of gaining better insight into our faith

- Wisdom also teaches us that we can become so accustomed to a good thing that we begin to take that good thing for granted
	- people often refer to a spouse or a close friend or a parent when they think about taking things for granted
	- but this idea can just as easily be applied to our thoughts on receiving the Eucharist at Mass
	- when you receive the Eucharist at Mass, is it an experience of gratitude? of reverence that you are receiving Jesus?  do you say Amen when you receive the Host?

- The freedom that we have to practice our faith freely and publicly because of where we live, that freedom does not exist everywhere in the world
	- there are those who have to hide their faith for fear of persecution
	- there are those who are not able to receive the Eucharist every Sunday at Mass
	- when was the last time you said thank you to God for the gift of the Eucharist?

- So as we prepare to celebrate the Eucharist, let us
	- think about the choices in our lives
	- are we taking the time to reflect on our choices to see if they were wise choices or not?
	- do we take the Eucharist for granted in our lives?
	- do we recognize it for the gift from God that it is?
	- are we allowing Jesus into our lives, to allow Him to help raise us up?
